HIGH FIBER
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

Here's another example of a font created for my work. High Fiber was designed specifically for use in creating sample character sheets for my game projects (if you don't know what a character sheet is, that's okay - just imagine a group of grown men and women doing tax returns as a form of recreation; that's the general aesthetic).

I wanted a very regular, slightly narrow handwriting font that I could use to cram long skill-names and other paraphernalia into a short line without fiddling with compression or ugly kerning tricks, but my standard handwriting fonts (Yank and Newfie) don't quite fit that bill. I needed the handwriting of somebody desperately in need of a high-fiber diet. I needed a pocket-protector sort of font.

To create High Fiber, I selected a particularly crisp and clean piece of graph paper, opened a fresh pen, sat with my feet flat on the floor and my posture flawless, and began, slowly, to write. I imagine I looked pretty silly, but I did it up at the Metro on the drag, and it's pretty dark in there.

High Fiber is a full-keyboard set with a few selected extended characters (like smart quotes, dashes and the all-important é needed for words like Pokéthulhu and Cliché). Enjoy!
