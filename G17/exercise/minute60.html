			    <p>
                    Bicep Curl
			    </p>
			    <ol>
				    <li>Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arm's length. 
                        Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. 
                        This will be your starting position.</li>
				    <li>Keep the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights. 
                        Continue to raise the weights until the dumbbells are at shoulder level. 
                        Hold the position for a brief pause.</li>
				    <li>Then, inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.</li>
			    </ol>
			    <p>
                    Hammer Curl
                </p>
			    <ol>
				    <li>Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. 
                        The elbows should be close to the torso.</li>
				    <li>The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. 
                        This will be your starting position.</li>
				    <li>While holding your upper arm stationary, curl the weight forward. 
                        Continue to raise the weight until the dumbbell is at shoulder level. 
                        Hold the position for a brief moment.</li>
				    <li>After the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.</li>

                <h1>Chest</h1>
			    <p>
                    Dumbbell Chest Press
			    </p>
			    <ol>
				    <li>Take a dumbbell in each hand and lay back onto a flat bench. Your feet should be flat on the floor and your shoulder blades retracted.
				    <li>Maintaining a neutral grip, palms facing each other, begin with your arms extended directly above you, perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
				    <li>Begin the movement by flexing the elbow, lowering the upper arms to the side. Descend until the dumbbells are to your torso.
				    <li>Pause, then extend the elbow and return to the starting position.</li>
			    </ol>
			    <p>
                    Dumbbell Flys
                </p>
			    <ol>
				    <li>Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
				    <li>Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.
				    <li>With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.
				    <li>Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out.
				    <li>Hold for a second at the contracted position.</li>

			    <p>
                    One-Arm Dumbbell Rows
			    </p>
			    <ol>
				    <li>Place the right leg on top of the end of the flat bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support.
				    <li>Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
				    <li>Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step.
				    <li>Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Switch sides when finished.</li>
			    </ol>
			    <p>
                    Wide-Grip Lat Pulldowns
                </p>
			    <ol>
				    <li>Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.
				    <li>Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip. 
				    <li>As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.
				    <li>As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back.
				    <li>After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.</li>
